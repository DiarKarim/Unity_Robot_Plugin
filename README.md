# Unity_Robot_Plugin
This project involves a Unity plugin for controlling the 3BOT or any other robotic maipulandum

Follow these steps to get started:
These steps assume that the 3BOT readme file has been followed correctly to:
i.) initialise the 3BOT files and "S" drive 
ii.) calibrate the 3BOT 

1. In visual studio: Run this script "3BOT-Demo_v2.cpp" via the 3Bot_VS visual studio project 
2. In Unity: Play this scene "3bot_unity_test_scene.unity" from the "3BOT_UnityTest" project 
3. Now when you move the 3bot handle the cursor in Unity should move accordingly


Next, I will add the following functionality:
1.) Collision detection in Unity
2.) Unity to 3Bot force command 
3.) Constant force channel created in Unity and send to the 3Bot via this plugin
